K. Chesterton—writer; modernist philosopher; friend to George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells and Bertrand Russell but, most importantly, author of a piece I can torture into an article on security.
Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s fence In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road.</description></item><item><title>The Ratio</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/the-ratio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 13:29:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/the-ratio/</guid><description>The Ratio In our work with large organisations we&amp;rsquo;ve developed a &amp;ldquo;rule of thumb&amp;rdquo; that quite usefully predicts the proportion of development and cybersecurity staff in the workforce. For companies whose primary business isn&amp;rsquo;t software development but have internal, established application delivery capability (banks, telcos, etc.) around 10% of the workforce are software developers.
At the scale these organisations operate at, typically an architecture function has split off from engineering and is around 10% of the developer total.</description></item><item><title>What is The Cloud?</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/what-is-the-cloud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 11:37:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/what-is-the-cloud/</guid><description>Is this guy really going to do a “What is the cloud?” article in 2020? Yes, he is. I mean, I am. Because I want to talk about the cloud. No, not cloud computing. No, not a series of tubes. Not &amp;ldquo;just someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer&amp;rdquo;. This cloud:
This actual cloud. We’ve all seen it thousands of times, and you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used it a lot if you’re reading this article. You might have seen it in use like:</description></item><item><title>The Chaos Butterfly of Security Standards</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/the-chaos-butterfly-of-security-standards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:32:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/the-chaos-butterfly-of-security-standards/</guid><description>The mathematician and meteorologist, Edward Lorenz, made the Butterfly Effect famous with his talk in 1972, &amp;ldquo;Does the Flap of a Butterfly&amp;rsquo;s Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s stuck in the popular conscious ever since. The notion that small events in a chaotic system can build to large changes over time and space.
In large companies I frequently see a hope that a similar mechanism will occur when a security standard is published to the company SharePoint.</description></item><item><title>The Biggest Misconception in Application Security</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/biggest-misconception-in-appsec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:41:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/biggest-misconception-in-appsec/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on this in previous articles, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth dedicating a little time to this misconception as it&amp;rsquo;s at the root of so many of the problems that organisations have with security and delivery. A common way to think about maintaining security while delivering software systems at pace is this.
Where rapid delivery of changes into production is one end of a scale, being secure is at the other end and, as an organisation, you pick where along the scale you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable according to your risk appetite.</description></item><item><title>Building a Culture of Quality</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/building-a-culture-of-quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:30:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/building-a-culture-of-quality/</guid><description>In my previous article I covered how security is just one aspect of the quality of the applications you&amp;rsquo;re building. Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus on the process of building high quality systems and, in a startling break with tradition, actually define what culture is so that we can talk meaningfully about culture change.
Let&amp;rsquo;s remind ourselves of the standard for software quality from ISO 25010:
It never makes sense to talk about &amp;ldquo;building a culture of security&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Number of Data Breaches is not a Good Security Metric</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/number-of-data-breaches-is-not-a-good-security-metric/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 11:30:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/number-of-data-breaches-is-not-a-good-security-metric/</guid><description>Ok, of course it&amp;rsquo;s not. Does this feel familiar though?
Budget gets allocated to cybersecurity Cybersecurity activities happen Everyone is reasonably happy, except the application delivery teams having cybersecurity activities done to them Terrible news - a data breach!
