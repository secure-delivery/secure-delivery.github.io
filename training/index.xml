The day-to-day decision makers make a huge contribution to prioritisation of work and the quality of the delivered product.
This foundational workshop gives all decision-makers an understanding of where security sits alongside overall product quality, what must be measured to inform their decision making around security, and how to implement the simple but powerful processes that keep security and overall product quality under control while delivering at pace.</description></item><item><title>Secure by Design With Agile Threat Modelling</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/training/secure-by-design-with-agile-threat-modelling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 21:53:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/training/secure-by-design-with-agile-threat-modelling/</guid><description>Threat modelling is an essential part of building secure systems. The United States’ Executive Order 14028 to improve the nation’s cybersecurity mandates threat modeling as part of the minimum standard for verification.
