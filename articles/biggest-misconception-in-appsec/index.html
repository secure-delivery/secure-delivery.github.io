A common way to think about maintaining security while delivering software systems at pace is this.</p><p><img src=/images/wrong-thinking.png alt="Secure Delivery Misconception"></p><p>Where rapid delivery of changes into production is one end of a scale, being secure is at the other end and, as an organisation, you pick where along the scale you&rsquo;re comfortable according to your risk appetite. This makes intuitive sense - if your mental model of software delivery is like driving a car and you&rsquo;re taking more risks with your foot down, going faster. The problem with this mental model is <strong>it&rsquo;s completely wrong</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/wrong-thinking-no.png alt="Secure Delivery Misconception"></p><p>Building software is one of the most complex human endeavours. It&rsquo;s not possible to deliver applications at pace unless the software is of high quality. The slowest release cadence projects I&rsquo;ve ever worked with have all been the lowest quality, worst designs and codebases and I&rsquo;m sure you have the same experience. These low quality systems simply <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be changed quickly. They will functionally fall apart if you try and everyone is, quite correctly, far too scared to try. Every change leads to unpredictable failures in an overly-complex system with:</p><ul><li>A <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud>ball of mud</a> architecture</li><li>Incomprehensible code</li><li><a href=https://wiki.c2.com/?GlobalVariablesAreBad>Global variables</a> and state</li><li>Poor <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/functional-decomposition.asp>functional decomposition</a></li><li>Specialist teams of developers, testers, architects and operations all handing off changes to each other with ill-defined responsibilities</li></ul><p>You simply can&rsquo;t deliver at pace unless you&rsquo;re paying attention to the non-functionals. Performant, interoperable, reliable, usable, maintainable and secure systems can be changed with confidence. They have:</p><ul><li>A decoupled design that allows for simpler subsystems or components of the system to be changed independently</li><li>Code that is clear, understandable and functionally decomposed well</li><li>Comprehensive instrumentation giving visibility into the running system in test and production so that any aberrant behaviours are immediately seen</li><li>Delivery teams that are cross-functional with continuous responsibility for all aspects of the system so that quality, <em>all</em> quality, <em>including</em> security, can be assured continuously without slowdowns</li></ul><h4 id=delivering-slowly-isnt-more-secure-its-_fearful_-and-if-youre-afraid-of-changing-a-system-then-the-system-is-_not_-secure>Delivering slowly isn&rsquo;t more secure, it&rsquo;s <em>fearful</em>, and if you&rsquo;re afraid of changing a system then the system is <em>not</em> secure</h4><p>If this misconception is how your organisation is thinking about security then what it&rsquo;s really saying is:</p><ul><li>We can&rsquo;t assure security of daily releases</li><li>A ticket raised for a security assessment won&rsquo;t even get assigned to a security tester in that time</li><li>Our security operations team would be swamped by daily changes going into production from all the development teams in our organisation</li><li>We don&rsquo;t have confidence that our development teams have the skills needed to deliver at pace</li></ul><p>And these are all valid, <em>fixable</em> problems. <em>Not</em> an absolute truth about software delivery pace being antagonistic to security. The first step is identifying the real problems, I&rsquo;ve listed some common ones here and I&rsquo;m sure you can think of more. The next step - fixing things.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s switch out security for another non-functional requirement that&rsquo;s very important to your organisation: performance. From my experience working with everyone involved in software delivery it helps to avoid any ingrained ways of thinking. Can you deliver rapid changes to your software systems and maintain a high level of performance, or even <em>improve</em> performance in the process? Of course you can! If you wanted to ensure high performance while evolving your applications at pace you would:</p><ul><li>Think about the performance impact of any changes during planning and design</li><li>Plan your overall system architecture with performance in mind</li><li>Make sure everyone knows how to write performant code in the languages and frameworks you’re using</li><li>Hire people with domain expertise in performance engineering to work with, train and coach teams</li><li>Peer-review code changes for the inevitable human mistakes that could affect performance</li><li>Share known-performant code and internal libraries across teams</li><li>Make performance a key consideration in the selection of any third-party libraries you depend on</li><li>Make performance a key consideration in the selection of any third-party services you depend on</li><li>Automatically test all changes for performance regressions on every commit so developers can catch and fix them early</li><li>Prioritise performance fixes in your backlog / development cycles</li><li>Inject comprehensive telemetry into your systems to monitor performance in production</li><li>Investigate & fix performance incidents in production and widely publish findings across the organisation to improve learning</li><li>Make maintaining high performance the responsibility of the teams delivering the applications</li></ul><p>Nothing controversial here - a sensible approach to meeting an important non-functional requirement. All of it equally applicable to security. Let&rsquo;s make the obvious substitution:</p><ul><li>Think about the security impact of any changes during planning and design</li><li>Plan your overall system architecture with security in mind</li><li>Make sure everyone knows how to write secure code in the languages and frameworks you’re using</li><li>Hire people with domain expertise in security engineering to work with, train and coach teams</li><li>Peer-review code changes for the inevitable human mistakes that could affect security</li><li>Share known-secure code and internal libraries across teams</li><li>Make security a key consideration in the selection of any third-party libraries you depend on</li><li>Make security a key consideration in the selection of any third-party services you depend on</li><li>Automatically test all changes for security regressions on every commit so developers can catch and fix them early</li><li>Prioritise security fixes in your backlog / development cycles</li><li>Inject comprehensive telemetry into your systems to monitor security in production</li><li>Investigate & fix security incidents in production and widely publish findings across the organisation to improve learning</li><li>Make maintaining high security the responsibility of the teams delivering the applications</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re a delivery team, doing these things takes control of the security of your systems. If you&rsquo;re a security team, ensuring your organisation is doing these things scales your knowledge and expertise across the whole business. Nobody, <em>absolutely nobody</em>, has to slow down.</p></div></div></div></div></section><style type=text/css>#header.transparent-header:not(.sticky-header) #header-wrap{background-color:#333}</style><script type=text/javascript>var nav=document.getElementById('primary-menu');var navLinks=nav.getElementsByTagName('a');for(var i=navLinks.length-1;i>=0;i--){var a=navLinks[i];var data=a.getAttribute("data-href");if(data==null){continue;}
