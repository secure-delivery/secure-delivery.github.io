Does this feel familiar though?</p><p><em>Budget gets allocated to cybersecurity</em><br><em>Cybersecurity activities happen</em><br><em>Everyone is reasonably happy, except the application delivery teams having cybersecurity activities done to them</em></p><p><em>Terrible news - a data breach!</em><br><em>Panic</em></p><p><em>Budget gets substantially increased for cybersecurity</em><br><em>Substantially more cybersecurity activities happen</em><br><em>Everyone is reasonably happy, except the application delivery teams having substantially more cybersecurity activities done to them</em></p><p><em>Terrible news - a data breach!</em><br><em>Panic&mldr;</em></p><p>That&rsquo;s not a great situation. A data breach is a trailing indicator aka a <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laggingindicator.asp>lagging indicator</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A lagging indicator is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them.</p></blockquote><p>So that&rsquo;s a terrible measure to base your decision making and budget allocations on. But a trailing indicator of what? We&rsquo;re going to need to determine that to be able to get to leading indicators. Leading indicators are a brilliant measure to base your decision making and budget allocations on.</p><p>Data breaches can occur in many ways - a phishing attempt could compromise a workstation and the attacker can pull out any data available, a laptop could be left on a train (remember when that was commonplace? Hooray for full disk encryption), an employee could walk out the door with a thumbdrive containing all your customer data, and the broad field of cybersecurity is concerned about all of these scenarios.</p><p>You&rsquo;re most likely to hit the headlines, however, with a data breach carried out over the internet and through your deployed applications. In this case we&rsquo;re talking about application security and application security has become the dominant part of cybersecurity by far. Why?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Software is eating the world.&rdquo;<br><a href=https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/>Marc Andreessen, 2011</a> or in the <a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460>WSJ</a></p></blockquote><p>As everything became software, cybersecurity became application security. Software spread out to cover more of our world and <em>down</em> to consume the infrastructure. Network? Some lines of config in a YAML file. Servers? Some lines of config in a YAML file, or Dockerfile, or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care just run this code and store this data&rdquo;. All part of the source code for your systems, all part of the application.</p><p>We&rsquo;re getting closer to what a data breach is a trailing indicator of. We just need to know what application security <em>is</em>. I&rsquo;ll have a go at defining that:</p><blockquote><p>Security is simply a non-functional requirement of your applications.</p></blockquote><p>A more holistic view is that security is a non-functional requirement of your application <em>and</em> the processes used to build and operate it. But those processes are there to instill the security into your application and it carries that with it as an intrinsic quality. Now, if security is part of the quality of your application what is software quality? We&rsquo;ve got a standard for that, fortunately, <a href=https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010>ISO 25000</a>. Good, that saves us a bunch of time, let&rsquo;s have a look:</p><p><img src=/images/iso25010.png alt="ISO 25010"></p><blockquote><p>The quality of a system is the degree to which the system satisfies the stated and implied needs of its various stakeholders, and thus provides value. Those stakeholders&rsquo; needs (functionality, performance, security, maintainability, etc.) are precisely what is represented in the quality model, which categorizes the product quality into characteristics and sub-characteristics.<br><a href=https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010>https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010</a></p></blockquote><p>Those clever folk at ISO have connected their quality model to value provided, otherwise it&rsquo;s a fairly meaningless exercise. They&rsquo;ve also sneakily given us a left-to-right order of importance to these characteristics of quality. Do you agree with them? Have a good think about each one, the value they provide, and the impact of improving or worsening each one.</p><p><strong>So higher quality applications provide more value, applications with poor security are of lower quality, data breaches are a trailing indicator of software quality.</strong></p><p>What are leading indicators of software quality? With another excellent bit of fortune, we have the work of <a href=https://g.co/kgs/8MoCNL>Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim</a> to help us here. Higher performing organisations derive more value from higher quality software delivered by high performing technology functions and, out of all things measured, the data analysis shows there are just four metrics that matter as leading indicators:</p><ul><li>Lead Time</li><li>Deployment Frequency</li><li>Mean Time to Restore</li><li>Change Fail Percentage</li></ul><p>Doing well on these four metrics when delivering software are leading indicators of your organisation being high performing and having high quality software. Bear in mind you don&rsquo;t need to be the best in the world overall - these metrics are relative to your competition. If your competitors have a lead time to deploy changes of a month and you can do it in a week, you (will) win.</p><p>What you will notice from these metrics is that functional suitability doesn&rsquo;t impact any of them. You can quite happily build completely the wrong thing for your market with extremely high quality. If you like. Ensuring you&rsquo;re building the right thing is a whole different article so I&rsquo;ll talk about that in a whole different article.</p><p>What <em>can</em> and <em>does</em> affect the four metrics that matter are the non-functional characteristics of your system. They affect these metrics, these metrics affect them, and they affect each other in quite an interdependent way:</p><ul><li>A system with high reliability will be decoupled without any single points of failure so change fail percentage will improve, mean time to restore will likely be quicker and deployment frequency will be higher because the decoupled parts can be updated separately</li><li>A system with high reliability will automatically detect abberant behaviours and terminate them, improving security</li><li>A system with high performance efficiency will be resistant but sensitive to attempted attacks that degrade performance, improving security</li><li>A system with a short lead time can be changed in production quickly, improving response time to security defects detected</li></ul><p>And so on. A high quality system will be more secure than a low quality one and the four metrics that matter will be <em>very</em> bad for a low quality system. Aim for high quality, deliver value, and be a high performing organisation.</p><p>Improving your non-functionals to achieve high quality means both paying attention to them and dedicating efforts to improve them alongside the functional characteristics of your system. We&rsquo;ve got an order of priority for delivering value in the ISO 25010 model, order your work priorities and effort allocation appropriately. Paying attention to them means measuring them, or you&rsquo;re flying blind. Some non-functional requirements are easier to measure than others - performance is straightforward, security not so.</p><p>There <em>are</em> measures you can put in place for security - an accurate count of security defects known in your system is a good start and at Secure Delivery we can help you choose the right tools to give you the accuracy you need.</p><p>A final thing to notice about the four metrics that matter is that if you have hand-offs from one team to another to determine the level of any of the quality characteristics, such as:</p><ul><li>Handing off to a test team to determine functional correctness</li><li>Handing off to a security team to determine security level</li><li>Handing off to a performance team to determine performance efficiency</li></ul><p>Then you&rsquo;ve already lost. The time taken, the lack of shared context, the miscommunication and the differing incentives across the teams will plummet your lead time, your deployment frequency and quite probably your change fail percentage as defects won&rsquo;t get fixed in a timely manner. You will not be a high-performing organisation. The quality of your software systems will be low.</p><p><strong>Structure your teams and your delivery process to ensure that the people responsible for delivery are also responsible for the quality of that delivery. <em>All</em> characteristics of quality. Allocate your budget and effort based on improving the leading indicators of quality, not by reacting to trailing indicators. See what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not working <em>long</em> before everything goes wrong.</strong></p><p>Move fast, deliver quality software, win in the marketplace.</p><p>Ok, this has been an awfully long-winded way to say &ldquo;Data breaches are trailing indicators of software quality because security is a non-functional aspect of quality&rdquo;, <em>but</em> the journey is often the interesting part.
