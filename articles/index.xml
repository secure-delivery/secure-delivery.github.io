The notion that small events in a chaotic system can build to large changes over time and space.
In large companies I frequently see a hope that a similar mechanism will occur when a security standard is published to the company SharePoint.</description></item><item><title>The Biggest Misconception in Application Security</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/biggest-misconception-in-appsec/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 09:41:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/biggest-misconception-in-appsec/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on this in previous articles, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth dedicating a little time to this misconception as it&amp;rsquo;s at the root of so many of the problems that organisations have with security and delivery. A common way to think about maintaining security while delivering software systems at pace is this.
Where rapid delivery of changes into production is one end of a scale, being secure is at the other end and, as an organisation, you pick where along the scale you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable according to your risk appetite.</description></item><item><title>Building a Culture of Quality</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/building-a-culture-of-quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:30:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/building-a-culture-of-quality/</guid><description>In my previous article I covered how security is just one aspect of the quality of the applications you&amp;rsquo;re building. Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus on the process of building high quality systems and, in a startling break with tradition, actually define what culture is so that we can talk meaningfully about culture change.
Let&amp;rsquo;s remind ourselves of the standard for software quality from ISO 25010:
It never makes sense to talk about &amp;ldquo;building a culture of security&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Number of Data Breaches is not a Good Security Metric</title><link>https://securedelivery.io/articles/number-of-data-breaches-is-not-a-good-security-metric/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 11:30:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://securedelivery.io/articles/number-of-data-breaches-is-not-a-good-security-metric/</guid><description>Ok, of course it&amp;rsquo;s not. Does this feel familiar though?
Budget gets allocated to cybersecurity Cybersecurity activities happen Everyone is reasonably happy, except the application delivery teams having cybersecurity activities done to them Terrible news - a data breach! PANIC Budget gets substantially increased for cybersecurity Substantially more cybersecurity activities happen Everyone is reasonably happy, except the application delivery teams having substantially more cybersecurity activities done to them Terrible news - a data breach!</description></item></channel></rss>
