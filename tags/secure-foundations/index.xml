The day-to-day decision makers make a huge contribution to prioritisation of work and the quality of the delivered product.
This foundational workshop gives all decision-makers an understanding of where security sits alongside overall product quality, what must be measured to inform their decision making around security, and how to implement the simple but powerful processes that keep security and overall product quality under control while delivering at pace.</description></item></channel></rss>
