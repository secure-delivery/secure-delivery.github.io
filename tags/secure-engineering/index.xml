      <description>Security defects in code are the largest contributor to security vulnerabilities in software systems. A NIST study in 2016 established that a programming defect was the root cause of 73% of all reported software system vulnerabilities tracked in the CVE database from 2008-2016.

      <description>Threat modelling is an essential part of building secure systems. The United States’ Executive Order 14028 to improve the nation’s cybersecurity mandates threat modeling as part of the minimum standard for verification. OWASP’s Top 10:2021 puts Insecure Design at number 4 of the top 10 risks to businesses.
To scale threat modelling to cover your whole organisation you must put the capability into the hands of of your product development teams.</description>
